"""Regression guard for the Debby example's GPT head.

Debby's "GPT" sub-agent must run on the ``codex`` harness, not
``openai-agents``. The openai-agents harness treats an unpinned model as a
Databricks model (``is_databricks_model = model is None`` in
``omnigent/inner/openai_agents_sdk_executor.py``) and, with no
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` in the environment, silently falls
back to ambient Databricks credentials — routing the "GPT" head through the
Databricks gateway instead of OpenAI. The ``codex`` harness is GPT-only, uses
OpenAI's native auth, and has no such unpinned-model Databricks fallback.

This is a non-live parse-only check so it runs in the default suite (the
dir-shaped example's own e2e coverage lives under ``tests/e2e``, which is
ignored by default).
